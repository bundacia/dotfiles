Johann Sebastian Bach (31 March [O.S. 21 March] 1685 â€“ 28 July 1750) was
a German composer and musician of the Baroque period. He enriched established
German styles through his skill in counterpoint, harmonic and motivic
organisation, and the adaptation of rhythms, forms, and textures from abroad,
particularly from Italy and France. Bach's compositions include the Brandenburg
Concertos, the Goldberg Variations, the Mass in B minor, two Passions, and over
three hundred sacred cantatas of which nearly two hundred survive. His music
is revered for its technical command, artistic beauty, and intellectual depth.
